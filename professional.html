            <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>In my journey toward a career in software engineering, I’ve taken on projects and roles that have not only honed my technical skills but also pushed me to innovate and lead. For instance, while interning at Sony Pictures Imageworks, I developed a Python-based tool to monitor reboot activity across machines, a project that taught me the value of data in troubleshooting and optimizing systems. At Tutela Technologies, I took on the challenge of enhancing data visualization for mobile networks, creating a dynamic mapping feature that significantly improved client presentations and decision-making processes.</p>
            
            <p>My professional development has been characterized by diverse experiences across the tech industry. From resolving complex technical issues at Sony Pictures Imageworks to enhancing testing efficiency at Shift (Redbrick) with automation tools, I've embraced each opportunity to learn and grow. These roles have not only expanded my technical toolkit—from Python and Java to data visualization tools like Splunk—but also allowed me to adapt and thrive in different team environments.</p>
            
            <p>My achievements extend beyond technical contributions. Leading the UVic VikeLabs Club, I’ve focused on creating a community where students can collaborate, learn, and grow together. This role has sharpened my leadership skills and deepened my commitment to the tech community. Additionally, my work in developing and marketing for Scorched Earth Winery, leading to an 80% increase in online engagement, showcases my ability to leverage technology for business growth.</p>
            
            <p>These experiences, from leading projects to driving innovation and fostering community, lay a strong foundation for my career in software engineering. I'm eager to bring my technical skills, leadership, and passion for problem-solving to new challenges and opportunities in the field.</p>
